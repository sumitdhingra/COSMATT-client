              I qualified as an Electrical Engineer, with an electronic bias. I spent a few years in the Thyristor drive
              development laboratory
              of a major UK electrical equipment manufacturer, where I was responsible for the development of their
              small drives
              range. After that I was part of a start-up enterprise designing and manufacturing small electrical
              equipment
              including motor controls. In the 1980s I joined Electro-Craft, one of the pioneers of brushless
              servomotor, providing
              application support for the European Sales activity. This involved evaluating proposed machine designs and
              recommending
              the correct servo components, including position controllers. It also involved on-site trouble-shooting.
              For
              a while I was also responsible for the design of some of the controllers and a range of small drives.
              Electro-Craft
              was eventually absorbed into Rockwell Automation, and I took over responsibility for the application
              support
              of Allen-Bradley Motion Control Products in Europe.

              After an interest in motors and control from an early age, I obtained an Honours Degree in Engineering
              specializing in electronics,
              electric motors, and servos. After specialising as servo design engineer at International Computers
              developing
              dynamic peripherals, I took up a European technical sales and support position with Electro-Craft, the
              leading
              high performance motor company. Electro-Craft went on to develop full servo-systems, so I prepared tools
              for
              mathematical analysis of dynamic applications to simplify motor selection and optimise mechanics. These
              tools
              firstly ran programmable calculators, later pocket PCs as these became available, and finally as full
              suites
              for evolving PCs and laptops. Electro-Craft integrated into Rockwell where I managed the European Motion
              Control
              Division, and participated in the motion analysis software development.
