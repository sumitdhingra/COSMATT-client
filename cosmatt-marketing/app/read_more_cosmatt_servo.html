                <p class="page-subheader text-center">
                  A servo system is usually defined as a system whereby the motion and position of a mechanism is
                  controlled using a feedback
                  device, by which the system can detect errors and act to correct them. The corrective action can be
                  performed
                  using electric motors or using pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders.

                  COSMATT is a course of instruction about electric servo systems and the optimal choice of servo motors
                  and drives (amplifiers)
                  to achieve specified requirements. Nevertheless, much of the instructive content applies to all servo
                  systems
                  irrespective of the type. It is designed to help both those with little knowledge of the subject to
                  become conversant
                  with it and those with existing knowledge to appreciate the finer points of the subject. The content
                  is modularized
                  and cover areas ranging from fundamentals to sophisticated applications. This allows users to skip
                  subjects they
                  are already comfortable with. The course content includes specially designed embedded calculation
                  tools, which
                  assist the user throughout the training process. This becomes extremely useful as it is impractical to
                  manually
                  calculate all possible permutations of a proposed system.

              development laboratory
              of a major UK electrical equipment manufacturer, where I was responsible for the development of their
              small drives
              range. After that I was part of a start-up enterprise designing and manufacturing small electrical
              equipment
              including motor controls. In the 1980s I joined Electro-Craft, one of the pioneers of brushless
              servomotor, providing
              application support for the European Sales activity. This involved evaluating proposed machine designs and
              recommending
              the correct servo components, including position controllers. It also involved on-site trouble-shooting.
              For
              a while I was also responsible for the design of some of the controllers and a range of small drives.
              Electro-Craft
              was eventually absorbed into Rockwell Automation, and I took over responsibility for the application
              support
              of Allen-Bradley Motion Control Products in Europe.

              systems for a global automation company. I had to specify
              servo components for industrial automation systems, perform start-ups and troubleshoot. In the early days
              I wrote
              my own servo sizing software using GW Basic and was later involved with the other authors in creating a
              world

              After an interest in motors and control from an early age, I obtained an Honours Degree in Engineering
              specializing in electronics,
              electric motors, and servos. After specialising as servo design engineer at International Computers
              developing
              dynamic peripherals, I took up a European technical sales and support position with Electro-Craft, the
              leading
              high performance motor company. Electro-Craft went on to develop full servo-systems, so I prepared tools
              for
              mathematical analysis of dynamic applications to simplify motor selection and optimise mechanics. These
              tools
              firstly ran programmable calculators, later pocket PCs as these became available, and finally as full
              suites
              for evolving PCs and laptops. Electro-Craft integrated into Rockwell where I managed the European Motion
              Control
              Division, and participated in the motion analysis software development.
